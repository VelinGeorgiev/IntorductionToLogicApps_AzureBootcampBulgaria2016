# Source code used for the demos

daTkzsGame - simple python-js game for demo purpose.

DataConvertor - simple asp.net api to convert one data format into another.

powerbi - solution from the official repository modified to meet the needs of the presentation.

Please note this code is used for the purpose of the demos and it is not production ready.
Except from the daTkzsGame, the rest of the code could not be of great use to anyone.

If you'd like to know more about how to connect your logic app to power bi or create custom data convertor, please refer to the official Azure Logic Apps repository - https://github.com/logicappsio
