# Workflow Definitions of the presented 3 demos

SaveTweets.json - saves tweets to one drive.

SharePointEmailApproval.json - sharepoint/outlook approval workflow.

TkzsGame.json - simple js game with leaderboards in powerbi.

Please note this code is used for the purpose of the demos and it is not production ready.
The definitions could not be of great use, but I have added them as a reference.
